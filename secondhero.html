          <h2>Project Details</h2>
          <p>
            Our aim is to bring verifiable data practices into the heart of the
            healthcare system. With blockchain technology, we eliminate trust
            assumptions by allowing anyone to verify the authenticity of data,
            processes and outcomes; since our solution allows us to collect data
            from its genesis and hash the records onto the blockchain, the
            tamper-proof nature of the blockchain allows the data to remain
            authentic and accessible when needed. This process reassures clients
            that their data remains safeguarded without the physical mechanism
            of trust put in place since the truth is now on-chain and can be
            verifiable anytime.
          </p>
          <p>Key goals include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building a tamper-proof audit trail for clinical records</li>
            <li>
              Certifying the validity of digital processes across institutions
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensuring transparent and open access to data flow to facilitate
              collaboration in the Desci industries.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This initiative has applications in clinical trials, hospital
            audits, patient data sharing and regulatory compliance.

          <h3>Proof of Reputation-Consensus Mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            As we know, data stored on the blockchain is immutable, meaning it
            can't be altered, transactions records are stored in form of a
            digital distributed ledger, this contains blocks of transactions
            where each block is connected to the previous block, so if a person
            decides to alter the records or possibly cause havoc to the system,
            he has to do that on several blocks containing the copies of the
            transactions that form the chain. In a blockchain, every transaction
            has to be approved by a group of network participants called either
            miners or validators before being accepted as part of the network to
            form a block. Consensus mechanisms are methods that allows
            transactions to be approved and validated then subsequently added to
            the blockchain. In a blockchain network, the consensus determines
            the security and performance of the overall system. There are so
            many consensus mechanisms that have been adopted by different
            blockchain technologies, these mechanisms include: Proof of Work,
            Proof of Stake, delegated Proof of Stake, Proof of Capacity Proof of
            burn, e.t.c. These different mechanisms have algorithms that enable
            them to function in certain manner so as to safeguard the network.
            The Proof of Reputation is Circular's native consensus mechanism,
            its approach is to permit equal participation of nodes within the
            network while defending the network against malicious actors and at
            the same time preserving true decentralization. Its concept is based
            on the process that different nodes participating in the network
            gains or loses reputation based on their behaviour in the network,
            take for instance, when a node behaves accordingly, it gains
            reputation but when it behaves inappropriately, it loses reputation;
            the nodes with the highest reputation values eventually becomes part
            of a consensus group that determines the state of the blockchain.
            This system depends on the reputation of nodes to secure the
            network; the Proof of Reputation is highly secure because network
            participants have to work hard over a period of time in order to
            gain their reputation. The Proof of Reputation consensus mechanism
            is considered a more viable option than others because, it is
            environmentally friendly and doesn't require high computational
            power, does not require a large amount to be staked before a node
            can participate in the network thereby reduces financial
            centralization to the barest minimum. In all, the Circular's Proof
            of Reputation based system is economically and environmentally
            friendly, it plays a vital role in the web3 space and promotes the
            core aspects of decentralization.

          <h3>Multichain Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchains can either be public, private or hybrid in their
            Architecture, though Circular protocol is classified as a public
            blockchain, but It is hybrid in its network, given that the network
            allows the functioning of both public and private chains,the private
            chains cater for the enterprises because they provide cheaper
            solutions to industries since many of them may not necessarily want
            to assume liability for their data beyond the lifespan of the
            project. The Multichain Architecture enables the Circular blockchain
            to scale in three dimensions namely: by increasing, the number of
            shards, increasing the number of chains, and by the parallelism of
            execution of transaction. This feature enables it to reach higher
            throughput over a long time. The multichain Architecture of Circular
            simply means that one blockchain can mint multiple blocks and
            increases the number of chains and performs parallel execution of
            codes.
