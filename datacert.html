      <h2>Why Certification Matters</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        In today's healthcare systems, ensuring data and process certification
        is critical. Imagine if your health records could be altered at will by
        those in power, who will be held accountable? What security guarantees
        exist to ensure you would receive the quality healthcare you deserve? If
        vaccines harm people due to system failures, can healthcare providers be
        trusted if they can alter records to cover mistakes? Circular Protocol
        enables organizations to certify their operations using tamper-proof,
        verifiable structures built on our blockchain.

        <strong>Data Certification:</strong>
        We provide a framework to cryptographically verify the origin,
        authenticity, and integrity of data, ensuring it hasn't been modified or
        corrupted. Our blockchain is designed around compliance requirements for
        healthcare and DeSci institutions.

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Process Certification:</strong>
        Our tools allow organizations to prove that defined steps and work flows
        were followed exactly as promised, eliminating the need for blind trust.
      </div>
      <p class="section-text">
        Through automation, cryptographic proofs and community-driven
        validation, we help healthcare institutions meet high standards of
        transparency and compliance.
