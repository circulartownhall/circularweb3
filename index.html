            <h2>
              Revealing Real-world Adoption Through Enterprise Adoption By The
              Founder
            </h2>
            <p>
              In one of the tech conferences, Gianluca De Novi explained the
              importance of this paradigm shift from just the crypto use case of
              the blockchain technology to the area where enterprises utilize
              the tamper-proof nature of this amazing technology to put their
              records on-chain, in order to make certification and validation of
              records easier and verifiable. Blockchain technology itself is
              often confused with cryptocurrencies, but its true potential lies
              far beyond digital coins. When enterprises or industries like
              healthcare adapt blockchain as an infrastructure to provide tools
              to certify and manage data on-chain, it opens the door to
              meaningful real-world applications. According to Gianluca De Novi,
              integrating blockchain infrastructure in critical industries
              ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in the
              sector, which eliminates trust assumptions. Enterprise adoption
              acts as a catalyst, it shifts blockchain from a complex financial
              innovation to a foundational layer of the digital economy. While
              crypto still remains an important part of the ecosystem, It's the
              data layer not the coin - that paves the way for real-world
              blockchain adoption. Circular protocol is the major player in the
              field that is driving this real-world adoption, by building a
              compliant infrastructure that will serve the needs of enterprises
              while still maintaining true decentralization in all aspects.

            <h3>About Circular</h3>
            <p>
              Circular protocol is a layer 1, fourth generation blockchain
              technology with focus on reshaping trust in the critical
              industries, most especially healthcare. Its aim is to leverage the
              power of the blockchain technology to solve real-world problems
              that deals with managing data and patients records, by providing a
              sure means to ensure that data is certified from its genesis and
              remains tamper-proof and accessible to the patient who technically
              owns the data. Circular protocol is not just another layer 1, but
              a layer one blockchain built not only to address the problem of
              the blockchain trilemma but embeds programmability and performance
              features in it's infrastructure. Circular, as another layer 1 has
              provided a grand solution to the problems encountered by other
              players in the field, due to the fact that it isn't just designed
              as a secured blockchain with an advanced consensus mechanism, it
              is a scalable paradigm that has advanced security without the need
              to sacrifice decentralization.
