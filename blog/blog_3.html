            Istamp provides the fastest way to certify your intellectual
            property and documents, whether you are protecting sensitive 
            documents, submitting official reports or seeking a simple proof 
            of authenticity Istamp is designed to make it fast, transparent 
            and secure.
            <blockquote class="quotes">
              Istamp remains the best tool out there to keep your work 
              safeguarded and authentic.
            </blockquote>
            The user interface is simple and anyone can use it to keep
            his creativity safe. You start by entering your email, input 
            your one time password sent to that mail, set your username which
            doesn't appear on certificates, Users can easily create certificates
            from the dashboard, to get started, you first select the data that 
            we want to certify, there are two ways to do this, by either dragging 
            and dropping documents, or by uploading directly from your device.
            Istamp supports any file type such as: pdfs, images, spreadsheets,
            videos, or research data; once any of these files is submitted, Istamp
            generates a cryptographic signature that proves the exact file exists
            at the exact time, the file itself is never stored or shared, Istamp
            only certifies its integrity, once a user uploads a file, he needs 
            to provide a simple and clear title of the file that helps recognize
            the certificate later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once users create certificates, the file uploaded becomes automatically
            certified and the fingerprint of that files is securely stored on a 
            decentralized ledger, the certificate remains tamper-proof time stampped
            and ready to be shared or verified anytime,users can also view or share 
            their certificates or create certifications of multiple files.
            When certified documents are shared, anyone can validate the certificate 
            using the link provided to upload the file and compare the fingerprint 
            with the original version on the ledger, once it matches
            it can be established that the document is valid meaning that there 
            has been no tampering or changes. Purchasing certificates is quite
            easy and simple with Istamp, all descriptions are clearly outlined 
            on the dashboard page, users can purchase as many certificates as needed
          </p>
          <p>
            Istamp enables seamless certifications, validation and sharing
            of trust between various parties, researchers who need to validate 
            trial results, manufacturers protecting vast data or an executive 
            proving documents integrity, Istamp gives everyone instant tamper-proof 
            certification, backed by a decentralized ledger, it is used to reduce 
            audits, accelerate compliance  and build trust into every file shared.
