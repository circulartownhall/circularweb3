            Certify is Circular's first specialized tool tailored for the healthcare 
            industry. It ensures security at every stage of clinical trials, helping
            researchers, hospitals, and healthcare providers maintain integrity and trust.
            Powered by the Circular advanced blockchain infrastructure, Certify
             is built to deliver secure, tamper-proof data certification for all clinical
             trial records
            <blockquote class="quotes">
              With Certify, healthcare providers and researchers can cut costs,
              reduce risks and streamline compliance effortlessly.
            </blockquote>
            The user interface is designed for simplicity and clarity. All essential
            data and certificates are neatly displayed, allowing users to quickly
            navigate and verify information. When a dataset is imported, 
            Certify generates: A unique tamper-proof digital certificates for each individual record and,  
            an aggregate certificate for the entire dataset.
            This creates an auditable trial of certificates, ensuring the records immutability over a long period of
            time and supporting regulatory compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
            During certification, Certify generates a cryptographic signature
            that captures the exact state of the data at that specific point in time and stores 
            its signature on the blockchain, without exposing the data which remains
            secured in the user database or cloud using zero-knowledge proof(ZKP)
            technology. Certification ensures the integrity of the data by allowing
            anyone to verify that the dataset has not been altered since the 
            certification process. In certify's workspace home, we have essential
            details like: data names, upload dates, validation status, and user 
            information. Anyone using the platform can create a new certificate 
            by clicking the Certify new record button and get started, a straightforward 
            process of uploading and creating a certificate is completed,
            users can upload files directly or share the url to continue, details 
            of the record is also required, this includes: naming the dataset, and 
            providing a brief description which makes it easier for identifying
            the dataset to any team members who may need to review it. There
            are basically two options for uploading, users can upload a file directly 
            or paste a hosted url. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To create a certificate, users need to first store their data by
            clicking the store data button, that allows the automatic gener
            ation of certificates and a unique hash of the dataset is securely 
            stored on the blockchain, adding a layer of tamper-proof traceability
            to your dataset. Every created certificate can be viewed and status
            updates can also be confirmed in real time making sure that the data 
            is being securely certified. Certify also allows room for validation,
            of certificates, which is the process of checking the dataset integrity 
            by comparing its current state against its original certified hash
            stored on the blockchain, if the data aligns with the original certified
            version stored on the blockchain, the certificate is confirmed as valid,
            assuring it remains secured and unaltered, this extra layer of validation 
            reinforces the dataset trustworthiness, allowing anyone to confirm
            that it has not been modified since its certification. Once the entire
            dataset has been certified, users can validate the certificate and gets 
            a confirmation message once the certificate is valid. Last validated 
            time of every certificate is also shown on the home screen. Certificate 
            can be validated anytime making sure that certificates remains tamper   
            proof. Circular is integrating more features to enable batch processing 
            and data uploads directly from hospital databases through SQL integration.
